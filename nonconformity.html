        feeling a bit stressed as of late and wanted to journal my thoughts. the reasons range from my econ midterm
        grade (now i have to decide whether to continue/pass fail/ drop) to the cis 1210 midterm tomorrow, work i am
        behind on, unread emails in my inbox, unattended classes, rejections from opportunities, an uncertain summer
        plan, fomo, social life, inability to focus, and sleep.
        <br><br>
        i was in the vp reading room and could not concentrate and decided to come down into the cafe. sitting here
        and drinking my kiwi guava celsius and reflecting on life, i think i need to figure out my priorities more.
        i realized that i was being paranoid about econ to the degree of believing that this would have a significant
        influence on the next opportunity/internship/job i applied for, feeling a sense of underperformance compared
        to peers and loss of motivation to learn, and blaming myself for not studying enough (although i tried my best
        and had less time than others to study because i had a cis hw due the night before). i find that i have to
        consistenly tell myself thet everything will be fine, sometimes not even believing it myself.
        <br><br>
        i know that this mindset lacks growth and openmindedness, but in the culture of penn, in an environment where
        people consistenly do well, it is difficult to hold yourself to lower standards. this prompted me to think:
        what do i really want, and more importantly care about, in my college experience?
        <br><br>
        i would want to step back from the penn bubble and gain a greater and wider perspective of our world. at penn
        we care about getting into prestigous clubs and interning for elite companies, yet what is the end goal of
        this pipeline apart from being the model successful person in life? what do we gain purely as individuals
        from this experience? not to mention many successful people’s paths are much more curved and twisted than this.
        <br><br>
        life is about so much more than getting good grades and securing a high-paying job. sure, all of that is great
        and people who achieve this might be fulfilled, but it does not mean any implication. penn will sometimes
        obscure this observation from you, making you believe that your professional self is the only one that should
        be valued. however, i care about other things too. i value the hours of sleep i get, number of books i read,
        miles i run, movies i watch, food i eat, friends i see, conversations i share, laughs i experience, memories
        i create, places i travel, people i help, lifestyle i live. and if i need to sacrifice these things in order
        to be at the top- preforming preprofessional individuals at penn, im not sure i want to be there at all.
        <br><br>
        we often feel imposter syndrome and forget that we are already amazing individuals. i believe this is a
        common trait among university students — everyone is running on a treadmill trying to keep up with the others.
        we think that if we step off the treadmill our lifes will somehow be ruined, that if we didnt pursue this
        opportunity that someone else is doing then we would decrease our chances of “making it” in life. this results
        in a cycle of endless comparison and constant struggles with self-worth — something toxic yet prevalent within
        high-achieving individuals. however, if we actually step off the treadmill we may be able to see that this
        endless cycle does not result in much satisfaction and happiness, and inflicts much more anxiety and suffering.
        it might result in us doing things we don’t want to do and pulling more all nighters than is healthy. most
        importantly, we lose sight of the other things in life that matter and become unable to find ourselves in the
        carbon-copies of engineers, quants, finance bros, and consultants that define penn’s student body.
        <br><br>
        i believe that the people who have a sense of self-actualization and inner fulfillment from what they do are
        the ones who shine. i value honesty, integrity, and character. in the future, i hope to be able to make peace
        with myself and truly make myself the main character in my life rather than a cog in the machinery of someone
        else’s cooporation.
