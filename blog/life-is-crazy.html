        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            I'm at a point in life where it feels like there's so many important moments that
            have happened already, but there's even more to come.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            It's interesting to take a look back to the things that I have done and how they have
            shaped me as a person.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            <strong>Some random but defining moments:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            1. Going to China every summer. I haven't been in 5 years now, but before that for also about 5 years
            I was consistently traveling back to China and getting to explore the cities there. As a kid anything
            you do for such a long period of time feels normal because you don't have as much life experience, but 
            looking back its a unique experience that really got me to love travel and being exposed to new things.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            2. Attending regular coding classes in high school. I didn't realize my mom's full intentions at the time,
            and I wasn't particularly drawn to coding, but I think that being exposed early on to the concept
            of coding was really helpful.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            3. Random phases of being into things. Art history, design, running, reading books, food and nutrition, etc. 
            have made me a bit knowledgable in some areas and shed some light on who I am.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            4. Working at Shake Shack for a summer. Feels kind of unreal but I was building burgers 
            exactly like in the cooking games. I probably could have done something else but this was
            the summer after senior year where I wasn't really expected to do anything, and for some 
            reason I wanted to do this.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            5. Going to college. I think this is a big one for everyone. For me, I didn't have the insight that 
            going out of state would be nice, but I'm glad that somehow I found myself on the opposite coast of 
            the US. There's just so many things that I wouldn't have learned or experienced if I had stayed 
            in a similar bubble to where I grew up in.
