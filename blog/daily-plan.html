            You may see this and think, yeah its just another to-do list. Basiccc. But guess what, Sometimes
            basic things are good. So here's how I currently like to structure the tasks I want to get done every
            day, in a way that makes me feel good, and is fun and productive.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Every day, there's 2-3 things I will dedicate a lot of time and energy into getting done. These are typically
            things that have upcoming deadlines, or are just really important to me. These could also be tasks that are more
            complicated, which I don't want to sacrifice quality for speed on.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Then, there's 2-3 things that I want to get done, but I'm not going to stress about. These are things that I can
            do in a more relaxed way, and I'm not going to beat myself up if I don't get them done.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Finally, I put everything else I think of into an ongoing list. I'm still thinking about how to refine this part
            of the process, but for now everything else goes here for simplicity. This could include things that don't require as 
            much bandwidth to complete so I can do them later, or are in no rush to be completed. Typically I select what I feel 
            like doing from this list, after I complete things from my other lists.
